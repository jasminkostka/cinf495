	<h1>Dancing</h1>
	<p>
	<strong>Dancing</strong> to kpop that has catchy beats and tunes is fun. K-pop can be super cute or edgy, it can also be grounded in hip hop sounds and elements. 
	Boy and girl groups do have a different style at time though.

For boy groups or artists(I am not saying that girl groups or singers don’t do this but they tend not to unless they are really hip hop or dance based

Hip- Hop This will definitely be a very typical one because pop especially kpop can be very loud at times and this really suits the music

Break dancing b-boying I guess less of this because it does require a lot of energy and has a really high risk of injury, however some groups do incorporate it into their dances for a wow factor

urban dance

modern dance

street dance at times too.

For girl groups or artists:

Hip-Hop Groups like Blackpink definitely do use this style of dance and other other dance centric artists

Modern dance Usually girl groups do not do break dancing so they usually stick to footwork and choreo instead
